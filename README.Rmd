# Extract Tables from PDFs #

**tabulizer** provides R bindings to the [Tabula java library](https://github.com/tabulapdf/tabula-java/), which can be used to computationaly extract tables from PDF documents.

Note: tabulizer is released under the MIT license, as is Tabula itself.

## Code Examples ##

There is currently only one function:

```{r}
library("tabulizer")
out <- extract_tables("example.pdf")
str(out)
```


## Installation ##

[![CRAN](http://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/tabulizer)](http://cran.r-project.org/package=tabulizer)
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/leeper/tabulizer.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/leeper/tabulizer)
[![codecov.io](http://codecov.io/github/leeper/tabulizer/coverage.svg?branch=master)](http://codecov.io/github/leeper/tabulizer?branch=master)

This package is not yet on CRAN. To install the latest development version you can:

```R
if(!require("ghit")){
    install.packages("ghit")
}
ghit::install_github("leeper/tabulizer")
```

Note that this package depends on [rJava](https://cran.r-project.org/package=rJava), which implies a system requirement for Java. This can be frustrating, especially on Windows. My preferred setup routine is to use [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) to obtain, configure, and update Java. You should do this before loading tabulizer.

In command prompt, install Chocolately if you don't already have it:

```
@powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command "iex ((new-object net.webclient).DownloadString('https://chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))" && SET PATH=%PATH%;%ALLUSERSPROFILE%\chocolatey\bin
```

Then, install java:

```
choco install jdk7 -y
```

You should now be able to safely use tabulizer.
